 * Error Handling:
 * - Ensure to handle errors during database operations, such as
 *   when the database connection fails or a query is invalid.
 * - Catch and log these errors to prevent the app from crashing.
 * - Provide meaningful messages to the user or developer.
 */

/*
 * Best Practices and Maintainability:
 * - Use descriptive variable and function names for clarity.
 * - Keep the schema and model definitions simple and focused.
 * - Use async/await for asynchronous operations to handle errors and
 *   make the code more readable.
 * - Document the purpose and usage of each schema and model.
 * - Follow SOLID principles to ensure code is maintainable and scalable.
 * - Keep the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) by using functions and
 *   avoiding duplicate code.
